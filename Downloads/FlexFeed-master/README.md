Innovative Idea
Our idea is to create an application which combines the feeds of multiple social media accounts managed by single organizations.  The incentive for the users of our websites is that they will be able to view all social media feeds under specific organizations in one place. Additionally, the stock market values for these companies will be displayed at the top of the page. This will be a useful tool for investors to keep up to date with the companies they are invested int. For example, if a user is interested in the social media feeds of Intel, AMD, and NVidia, they can see all of these feeds in one place. The user will not have to navigate to each social media website and further sift through seas of content to find what they want. 

	Furthermore, users will be able to create “groups” of feeds that they want to look at, and subscribe to other “groups” created by other users. If a user is interested in keeping a feed for tech companies, and a separate feed for agricultural companies, they may do so with the option to combine them when they want to. 

Important Data
	What I’m thinking (could be totally wrong I still don’t know what this question is asking)
	*Users: Profile data (though we may not be able to include this as one of our data sources)
	*Groups: “groups” of organizations user is subscribed to. Maybe they want a feed for tech companies and a feed for agricultural companies. 
	*Companies: While users will be able to say “I want to see content from Google and here is Google’s twitter, insta, and FB”, we can also hard-code some pre-determined “packages” for companies that are popular. If we know a lot of people are going to want to see Google, let them type “google” and subscribe to everything related to it. This can be it’s own data model?
	*Content: the literal content we’re sucking in from third parties (mock data) will need to be modeled
	Feed: will a feed need to be modeled? May need to consider this if we’re going to end up doing a lot with dynamic feeds
User Interface
1-2 paragraphs highlighting the major user interface parts that your application will support. It should include at least 5 views/pages not including the login/logout page.

	The two primary views for this application will be the “feed” that makes up the home page which displays the content of different social media accounts, and the user profiles that each user can access to see the basic stats and settings of their accounts.

	Other views for the application will include an interface in which the user can see the content they are subscribed to, and form groups of feeds. and from there choose which feeds (ones to which they are already subscribed) to display on their home page. There will also include some sort of navigation menu for users to get from one part of the application to the other. The last major view for our application will be a view in which users can see groups of feeds formed by other users, such that they can save time and subscribe to predetermined feeds instead of creating their own.
